This is simple back-end User Managment Application.

## How to install the back-end part of our project.

1. First create a folder with the name back-end and open the same folder in the terminal (cmd or Powershell) and type git clone https://github.com/sanito94/java-project.git --> that is how we clone the back-end part of the  project.
2. Open the cloned project with IntelliJ.
3. Top right corner should be a green pointer. Click on it to start the back-end of the project.

Also there is a way to create a jar file to open the back-end easier.

1. On the right side of the project should be a letter "m" (lower case).
2. Click on it.
3. Then click on "demo".
4. After that click on "Lifecycle".
5. Then double click on "package" to create a jar file.
6. After you receive the green message BUILD SUCCESS go to the directory of the project java-project\target
7. Open a terminal on this location and type java -jar demo-1.0.0.jar

   That's how we start the back-end of our project through jar file.
